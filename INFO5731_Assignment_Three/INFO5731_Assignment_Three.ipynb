The phone looks brand new besides some very minimal/ light scratches (almost impossible to notice) and the battery life is still at 100%. I also like that there was a screen protector on the phone', '  Phone was not unlocked could it use it', '  The screen came cracked and popped out of the frame. Hopefully the return process goes smoothly.', '  Be careful mine had a scratch on screen very small but still 😢 their Used. People dont want used I phones with scratches', '  This is the best experience I have ever had with buying a renewed phone. The phone came in it’s original box with original charger and cable and the phone looks excellent, not one scratch on it absolutely beautiful and the battery health was at 100%. I definitely recommend the seller GoOverstock, as I will definitely be buying from them again.', '  I fought it for the longest time but I finally gave in and upgraded to the iPhone 11 from the iPhone 7. I looked other places online, but the price was way out of my price point. I felt comfortable buying this phone from Amazon because it was certified refurbished and I’m still happy that I did.', '  The box didn’t come with ear phones. The phone kept turning off by itself after set up. Some apps had to be deleted before they’d quit shutting off on their own.', '                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I just wanna tell everybody this is NOT A SCAM!!!! This phone is so amazing, great battery life, Face ID everything. Unfortunately mine didn’t come in an iPhone box but I was too much worried about that but it did come w/ a charger . Please get this phone  don’t let any of these reviews scare you! I will be doing a month review on this phone for more updates.

I got the 64 gb product red unlocked iPhone 11 which was, I believe a Verizon unlocked phone. My phone came in the iPhone 11 apple box with a original apple charger and original apple brick.  When I set up my phone I just put in my T-Mobile sim and the phone started working with my data. I did not need to get it activated or anything.', \"  My phone re start over and over again, that's so sad because the i phone looks like new😶\", '  I received my phone a day early and it came exactly as I imagined. I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone on the internet, but I truly have no complaints. The phone came in perfect, like new condition and has been working great with my carrier and in general.Came with a charger and charging block as mentioned in the description. It also came with a screen protector that was already put on the screen! That was an awesome and much appreciated touch. There’s also 60 day warranty and free returns just in case something were to happen.I’m incredibly pleased. Would definitely recommend to anyone!', '  Very disappointed with this purchase: Was same price as a brand new Apple I-Phone. This phone had 2 deep scratches on screen, did not come with earphones, was not an Apple charging cord, (although it had a sticker saying it was), was not an Apple charger. Also was never able to install I cloud.', '  been using iphones for a a long time. i needed a new one & saw this online for a good price. i dont have any complaints it works great. camera quality is amazing. it came with a charger, but *did not come with headphones* and it did not come in the classic “iPhone” packaging which didnt bug me but other people might care. i definitely recommend but if you want the headphones id buy them separately.', '  Amazon renewed phone. Was expecting minor cosmetic issue as described, however there was a decent size mark above the volume down button and the volume down button does not function properly. Contacted amazon and the seller and have not gotten this resolved.', '  Don’t trust the refurbished phone from Tech Exchange!! The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word.  Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When  I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I’ve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly.', '  I haven’t had the phone for 2 weeks and now the power button isn’t working and now the seller isn’t responding !!!', '  IPhone was shipped in two-day delivery. The box inside of a FedEx bag came opened but the FedEx bag itself was untouched, so I presume it was not completely closed before sealing the bag. The phone came with no scratch or sign of usage at all, a screen protector (nice touch) and generic certified usb cable and charger. No earphones as described. Battery life is 100%. So far it looks and works good. Im only a little concerned that it gets quite hot in the back.Im only doing the math and believe $639.99 is still a high price for a refurbished. If you want replace the generic stuff by purchasing an original charger + cable + earpods + connector, the total price will go beyond a brand new phone.', '  Great product. Looks and works exactly like new', '  \"Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice\" is is a false statement in their add for Amazon. When I received the phone there was a paper inside the box saying not compatible with Sprint or Boost Mobile. I happen to use one of those carriers, and rather then erasing all my info that I already had transferred from my old phone to the new phone and mailing the phone back I chose to switch carriers which was an additional pain. So BuySPRY won in the end but I will never purchase from them again.', '                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I purchased this iPhone 11 because it said it was unlocked. I have always owned unlocked iphones and never had troubles with them. I live in Guatemala. This iPhone 11 was working for a few days but all of the sudden \"stopped\" recognizing my SIM card. As you can see in the video the issue is not my SIM card because it works in my old and unlocked iPhone 8. Since I am not in the USA I lost almost $600. Beware, don\\'t buy this product. It is a complete scam.', '  Excelente teléfono 👍 y muy buena la cámara lo recomiendo 100%', '  My son loved this phone. We had no problems setting anything up. Worked perfect. In brand new apple box as well', '  I just received this phone on Friday(3 days earlier than expected🤗🤗)and it is absolutely lovely🤩. It came in a generic box with an apple compatible charger and cable. No scratches or imperfections that I can see at this time . The battery capacity is 100%. It looks and works like a brand new device.😁😁✅', \"  Every things right,  battery came with %100 capacity,  and it arrived 4 days early through FedEx,  i got the color and device storage I ordered.  Theres a few scratches on the bare screen which prove its used,  (i peeled the screen protector it came with off so i could put my tempered glass one on) but theyre invisible when a screen protector is on.  Phone is lighting fast and im just so happy!I had some doubts when buying this phone because there weren't enough reviews on it and it was used.  But its entirely like new,  although you dont get the unboxing experience of buying it brand new,  and earbuds arent included. Im happy i got a discount and that i didnt buy a new one and just have this one sit around and get scrapped for parts or something. I honestly dropped $690 bucks on this thing and i was gonna go ballistic if it didnt show up,  but it came early and im so relieved and happy with it,  its absolutely beautiful. Also the battery life on this for an iphone is great,  i came from a 2016 SE,  so a big change.\", '  I shopped around a lot for a renewed, refurbished iPhone 11. This was not the cheapest but really close. The selling point for me is that it comes with a 90 day warranty and refund policy and is sold through Amazon Prime. We received the phone 4 days ago. Upgraded and transferred everything from the iPhone 7 to the 11 flawlessly. Plus, the phone had no cosmetic issues at all. It looks brand new. We have bought a refurbished iPhone 7 and now this 11. Both worked perfectly.', '  The phone comes in the original iPhone box which was a nice bonus and difference between other companies that send unlocked iPhones in normal cardboard boxes and it works perfectly', '  Work totally fine so far, I’m satisfied with the functionality. But It didn’t come with earphones.', '  As far as buying this product from this specific seller, my experience has been great! Nothing to complain about. There were no scratches in the glass display, not to mention there weren’t any on the back glass or camera lenses either. But as far as the phone itself, I’m an android person but my first smartphone happened to be an iPhone and I had gone through a couple generations of them. I’m pleased to say that this device feels great but, it’s still an iPhone and to that, I mustn’t give a full 5 star review. Android gang.', '  This is not a scam!! I repeat this is not a scam! I love iPhones, I always want a nice good working phone that I know won’t take a dump in me because me being a single mom I need to beable to keep in touch with school and grandpa so if anything happens I’m aware right away! I love this phone! No scratches no dings! It’s like brand new!!! It looks new! And works like new!!! Comes with a screen protector! I am in love!!! The battery capacity is 100%! And it’s a killer deal for the price of this kind of phone!! It’s well worth it and it came in two days with my Amazon prime earlier than it said it would! You will be happy! I highly recommend!', '  Bought refurbished I’m assuming only open box as the item seemed 100%brand new would recommend the seller', \"  It's ok\", '  Recomended!!', '  This phone is great! (Please excuse the somewhat blurry pics, I have shaky hands) The battery health was already at 100% and its has barely any cosmetic damage. Save for a super tiny little nick at the top which is barely noticeable unless I shine a camera directly at the area. Also, the phone came preinstalled with a screen protector! I guess its a bit of a minus that it doesnt come with headphones, but I already have airpods, so that doesn’t bother me. It’s something to keep in mind when you purchase anything from Amazon Renewed. The phone came in four days early too which is dope.', '  So pleased. The phone came with a screen protector on it already even! And we’ll placed! No scuffs. Phone is seriously like brand new. Battery is 99%. I was skeptical after a bunch of 1 star reviews but figured I would try it because there is a 90 day guarantee and return. Don’t feel scared about this deal. Try it out. You will be pleased.I got the black 256gb unlocked iPhone 11 just FYI.', \"  I have never bought a used phone before and I've never bought one online. I always went through my carrier. However, this time I was ready to save some money and get an unlocked phone. I was a little nervous but I did some research and then took a risk since I had time to return it for a full refund if it didn't work out. The phone came in perfect condition and works like new. To me, I can't tell the difference between this phone and a brand new one! I've been using it for about 4 days and I've had no issues! Definitely worth the risk.\", '  For the most part everything is okayDifferent parts of the screen won’t work during certain timesSo I have to lock and unlock my phone constantly Nd hope it will work afterWhile writing this review I can’t even hit the bottom right corner to add punctuation unless it comes up from autocorrectWhen I contacted the company they told me to hard reset it and it should work afterThat worked for less than a day and I don’t want to have to hard reset my phone every other day for it to work when I spent seven hundred dollarsCan’t even use numerical charactersUpdate I reached out to them again saying their advice didn’t work and haven’t received a response and it’s been a week', '  If you’re thinking about buying this buy it right now! I had iPhone 7 and wanted another phone I can have years to come it took me two months to buy this because how much money. When I did BOY! I have never been so happy! I can’t express how happy and thankful iam to this company! Everything transferred over in less than 15 mins it was activate it with metro pcs within 10mins. I do have small hands so sometimes it’s hard to hold with one hand haha! The camera is awesome sound is awesome the color is greatit’s fast and up to date! It came with a screen protector you can buy another one. Get a good case I got mines from metro than I order one from red bubble. My watch paired fast dude! Buy this ASAP you’ll love it calls is cool it drops when I’m in a dead zone but that’s my services obviously turning the phone off tho is weird af 😂😂 buy a real apple charger got mines from Meijers for $20 charge my phone fast the battery life was 100%! It last about a 11 hours until it dies', \"  I got this when the battery life in my last phone, the LG V30 started tanking. I figured that I could easily try the current iPhone and sell it again if I didn't like it. I am pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything this phone offers.I'm going to start with the battery life, because that is the because surprise I have had coming to this phone. On day one with my old phone, I would get at max 6 hours of SoT (screen on time) before the phone would die. That was typically enough for me to go from 6am to 10pm with enough left over for me to not feel worried about dying in the middle of the day. Prior to buying this phone that battery life dropped to roughly 3.5-4 hours of SoT before dying.This new (refurbished I know) phone easily gets ~8 hours of SoT, easily going even higher depending on what I'm doing. I can go a full two days without a charge. That's with bluetooth on 24/7. To say I am happy with the battery is an understatement.The other features, are also pretty good. Not anything that blows me out of the water, but definitely at least as good as the other competition. The face unlock, which I assumed was going to be terrible, is much better than I expected. I would still prefer a fast fingerprint sensor, but this thing does the job almost as well. I have had a few instances where it refuses to recognize me on the first attempt, but they are uncommon. The camera is as good as you would expect from a modern smartphone, with several extra features that are actually useful in certain circumstances.Long story short: I will definitely be sticking with this phone for the foreseeable future.\", \"  After only 3.5 months the phone is completely dead and will not charge.  Took to Apple store and was told it would have to be replaced.  WTH!  Ordered and received early October 2020.  Started having charging issues last week and now it is completely dead.  And wouldn't you know it is past the return date by a mere 12 days.  Come on Amazon, you sold me this product you need to stand behind it or at least replace or refund something that lasts only days longer than the return window.  BS!\", '  Great phones... I initially bought one for my daughter and ended up ordering one for myself', '  Well I got the iPhone 11 yesterday and it currently right now will shut off every 5-10 mins , I have tried multiple times to contact the carrier and they haven’t emailed me back or nothing which I spent 700$ on a phone I’d like to get atleast a phone I can have a conversation on .. I don’t even want my money back I just want my phone fixed because it’s honestly a great phone but I think you should get a better technician that works on your phones cause I even called Apple to see what they recommend I do (that’s what they said ab the technician ) but I’m just disappointed I was so excited now I just feel ripped off ):', '  I can’t send messages to anyone who doesn’t have an iPhone. The power button doesn’t work correctly and often times Siri doesn’t respond. The only way to get the issue corrected is to be without a phone until the seller sends me a new one.

Was packaged nicely & came with an adapter and a charging cable (no headset). Iphone product Red body was in good condition. Small scratches on upper corner . Very very happy with purchase', '  Works great.', '  I am absolutely happy with my purchase! I’ve gone through the reviews and was ready to order right after. The only thing is my battery health was at 84% as I seen others with 100% which is fine by me. It’s nothing to go get a new battery when and if that time comes. As you see in the pictures the phone is in great condition annnndddd it’s unlocked so you can use any phone service for it. I’m digging the picture quality especially after upgrading from the iPhone X to this. What a difference a upgraded phone makes! It came with a cute case plus a charger. If you’re looking into this phone I’d say go for it. I’m on day 1 and I’m excited!!! (UPDATE! April 18th) I’m 1 month in with the phone and it’s still working great no issues at all.', '  A BIG thank you for selling iPhones on Amazon! I wanted this phone so bad and couldn’t get my hands on it anywhere unlocked. I am so glad I could buy in through Amazon, This is how we get everything so we knew it was reliable. The phone did not come in an apple iPhone box, but a box just the same with a charger no headphones. But I could care less because all I wanted was the phone. Works great, you wouldn’t even know the difference. I have since told friends and family to do the same when looking for a new phone. Plus it was much cheaper then I found it anywhere else. Very pleased that I got exactly what I wanted for an amazing deal!', '  No scratches or damage on the screen, or, for that matter, any part of the phone!

Only one, barely noticeable scratch on the screen and a very tiny scratch on the side that you can notice if you hold it really close to your face. Overall I'm very satisfied. I've had the phone for 24 hours now, works really well and fast and battery is still going since I charged it yesterday, it's at currently at 29%. If any unusual changes occur in the near future I'll update my review but I doubt it since the phone is in near perfect condition\", '  My sister is absolutely in love with this phone 😍 she was so surprised when I gave it to her, very fast shipping packaging was great.', \"  Certified. Refurbished. Quality Controlled. 70-point inspection.All indicators that you better insure any and every product purchased under the brand BuySpry because as the name suggests it will break quickly. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones that buy second hand and receives a product that functions and lasts. You have no assurance or guarantee, just a wish. Be very careful within initial return period (most often 30 days) as any even small issue needs to be addressed. That issue, whatever it may be will prove fatal in due time. It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right? Do not buy from this organization if you plan to gift. Please do your loved one a favor and keep BUYSRY's mediocre business and risk to yourself. Just buy her something new you cheapskate! Good luck and stay healthy.\", '  camera came slightly scratched but overall a good purchase', '  It’s a refurbished phone I don’t mind that it didn’t come in an original box, the phone itself is in very very good shape, I was so skeptical about buying this phone from amazon since it’s my first time buying a phone online but it is in very good condition! No cracks no scratches ! Looks brand new !! Seems to be working fine for now hopefully it stays that way I just need to see if it’ll work with my carrier, it came with a screen protector which was a nice touch :) really happy with the productUPDATE!!!! After a Month or two of having it, it still works really great! Batter life is long and it charges super fast. Highly recommend', '  Slight micro scratch on the screen, but overall good condition for an open box', '                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0The lock screen is flickering and getting blurry .. everything else seems to be fine , I tried to restart it again but it’s not working', \"  It came in perfect condition, no scratches, nothing was wrong. The battery life was at 100 percent. I had no complaints. One thing I noticed was that the app snapchat is glitchy on the phone. If you try to edit something for your story it just discards it after 30 seconds. Other than that,  it didn't come with earphones. As most people know the Iphone 11 has no headphone jack. So it's crucial that when we buy these phones we should get everything like new. Also, the charger is probably only a foot long. I like to play games or change my music while i'm laying down. I can't do that because the charger is so short. Last but not least, when you get the phone, the instructions are horrible. It tells you to download an app and what not, that just glitches your phone. Don't do it. Instead look up a video online on how to insert a sim card into an Iphone. From there, when you turn on the phone it will have instructions set up from apple. Do not! I repeat do not! Use the instructions provided. If you are switching from android to apple, it will take you longer to set up your phone because you need an apple ID. Also, you need to save your contacts, and write them down. Even after saving all my contacts to my sim card, when I inserted it, none were there. So it's crucial to remember your contacts.\", '  I received a phone that had a crack in the screen which wasn’t that big of a deal but the something was off with camera though compared it my boyfriends phone who ordered the same one from Apple and I think it was replaced with a different one and the biggest problem with the phone was that it’s kept restarting I thought maybe I was doing it by accident but no it would turn off while I didn’t have it my hand but using my AirPods . I also had problems trying the return the phone as the shipping label they sent roundly be taken by fedex and I had to pay myself all around you’d be better off buying new phone from Apple it ended up being cheaper .all around I paid $780 for the phone unlocked from Apple don’t waste your money', '  Got my phone in two days rather than five standard shipping days! I was happy it came sooner than expected!  I was nervous about ordering a renewed phone online because I didn’t want to spend $700 on a phone not knowing if it  was damaged or not, but I’m happy to say it came like brand new with no dents or scratches!! I’m so happy I made this choice because it saved me almost $300 from ordering on the apple website. Would definitely take the chance if your looking to buy the phone from them. The phone came in a different box with just a charger, FYI.', \"  This review is based on the renewed status of the phone and not of the iPhone itself. I had previously purchased a renewed Galaxy phone from Amazon and the phone was practically new for a small fraction of the price and it came with the original box and accessories. I thought it'd be worth it to save $100 or more since my last experience went so well. Unfortunately, the iPhone I received was very visibly used with scratches littering both sides of the phone, but without deep cracks to the screen. The battery's health was on the lower side. The phone also came in a generic box with generic accessories, which was to be expected since it is in the item description, but when you look at what you get for the renewed price it seems like a poor deal. Thankfully Amazon has a longer return period if the phone doesn't work out for you, but I only needed a few minutes with the phone to know that I'd rather buy a new phone from Apple for $100 more.\", '  I only dislike that I didn’t receive headphones with the order. Everything else was on point', '  I’m pleasantly surprised with this transaction.  I’m a true skeptic and regularly conduct extensive research when making this type of purchase.  The phone doesn’t come in original packaging and the cord and wall adapter are definitely not Apple products. The usb connection on the wall adapter had was bent and i could not slide the usb into the adapter....that was tossed into the trash.  With that said, the product I care most about was the phone itself and it is exactly as advertised.  It stared right up and went through start up process.  My entire phone was transferred within an hour and I was on my way.  I’ve been using it for about 4 days now and the battery life is strong and all the features work perfectly (no sticky buttons, etc).  I would definitely recommend this vendor if you only care about getting the iPhone as it’s supposed to be.  If you’re concerned about packaging and having a “uniquely” Apple experience, you may want to pay the additional $400 at the Apple store.', \"  Not gonna lie, after reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant to buy a Renewed phone, but in the end I'm super glad I did it! My phone came a day earlier than I expected, was nicely packaged, and already had a screen protector applied (no bubbles!). Set up and transfer from my old 6+ was simple. Got my apple watch transferred over. Cameras all work great, face ID has no issues so far, etc. Obviously it's been less than a day, but so far, so good! ♥\", '  Not gonna lie i was a little skeptical at first, im like dang did i really spend that much money on this what if its a scam? but im more than happy with the results. Battery health is on 100, phone is in perfect condition, came with new charger (no headphones tho), and there was no trouble transferring data from my old phone to the new one. I didnt even need to call my carrier to turn on the phone, just simply placed my sim card in. Definitely recommend this (if you dont mind the price lol).', '  The phone came in with scratches on it but after I put the screen protector on you can’t see it and whenever you put the screen protector on it’s gone have some like bubbles I put it on over and over and the bubbles seems to not go away but, overall it’s good I guess it doesn’t have YouTube but I’m satisfied I guess but, the price should’ve been lower than this since it’s refurbished and still come in the mail kinda mess up. The face recognition works fine battery was fine the setup was good only took 5 mins.', '  Cheapest iPhone 11 with 128gb that I could find online and I did ALOT of searching. Great buy! Love my new phone and the camera quality is amazing', '  It’s refurbish but I got all brand new (apple box with original charger but missing the ear plug)', '  The phone came in great condition. It works great! No lag! No issues! The battery life is great as well. I’m happy with the quality of the phone. I’m happy with my purchase! :)', '  I paid $ 720 but the screen was scratched.  Should not be bought at this shop.', '  Not user friendly. I might have to return it. I have to learn how to clean it before I send it back as it loaded my pictures from my other phone.', '  So I gave the phone another chance after it kept glitching on me but it’s definitely a no. The phone already came cracked on the side where the lock button is, I guess that’s why the phone won’t power off for me to complete the activation. Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn’t hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. I’ve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again. First time shame on you, second time shame on me & there will NOT BE A THIRD. People please read these reviews carefully because the person selling you the phone do NOT care. They fix these phones that’s broke & try to sell them thinking they’ve found a dummy because most won’t return the phone but I had a little time today & will have more when I get my refund today. I’ll give the phone one star because the phone takes nice back pictures but THATS IT.', '  The product came in a timely fashion. I like that it came with a charger no headset though charger not original but can’t complain for the price you are paying great deal and the phone is great condition', \"  Honesty is greatly appreciated these days. They delivered exactly what they promised: The phone arrived timely and it looked brand new. Everything worked smoothly as I expected. Unfortunately, I wasn't very thrilled about the phone size because I have always liked larger phones, so I contacted the seller for a refund. They kindly instructed me as to how to return the item in order to get a full refund back on my card. So far, so good. No complaints and I would definitely do business with these people again.\", '  Received phone.  It looked good, then after charging it overnight the screen was a jumble of blurred vertical lines.  Amazon insisted we had to deal with the seller.  Could not clear the phone as the screen didn’t work.  Communication from the seller was scripted, they never really answer your questions.  Sent phone back to seller.  They refunded 1% and kept 99% as a restocking fee!  Then we had to force Amazon to deal with it to get a full refund.  Horrible seller, buyer beware!!!', '  All they did was replace the glass. The sides of the phone are all scratched up not refurbished at all and the cables included are all aftermarket... not really pleased with the way the phone looks at all. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a new one.', '  The Face ID do not work I tried everything to fix it  In wouldn’t buy from dis seller again', '  I was a bit skeptical about buying an iPhone renewed off amazon instead of new but my worries were soon gone after the iPhone came in without any damages and at 100% battery health. Besides not getting the official iPhone box with the earphones, I still received a working charger/power adapter & a screen protector installed on the iPhone already. Very satisfied with my purchase.', \"  If there was a way to leave a 0 star, I would. I got the phone in the mail, super excited to get it up and running, and it wouldn't turn on. I called Apple and was on a call with them for 30 mins and they couldn't help me get the phone on either. Needless to say, I'll be returning the phone without even getting a chance to use it.\", '  Just got my iPhone 11 today and I was so anxious of using it but had to wait 2 hours for everything to set up. After that a message popped up saying that my phone screen may not be genuine so I freaked out because it supposed to be all ortigal? Right well apparently the screen is not authentic at all... hope my review and evidence works to y’all. I scanned my phone with a program called 3utools, hope it works.', '  Phone doesn’t work on the providers they say it will. I really wish I’d paid attention to the 1-star ratings before I bought it.Pros: the phone is in great condition and it works wellCons: It’s not really unlocked – or its some weird hardware configuration. It won’t connect to the providers they said it would. I was on a Verizon network and bought the phone so I could switch to sprint. It didn’t work on sprint. I contacted the seller’s support, and they gave me lots of things to try. I tried them long enough for the return window to pass. Then they basically said, too bad for me.If I had it to do again, I’d spend a little more and get something that works properly. Or just returned the phone and got another.', '  I requested an exchange because the phone I got reset on me a few times while trying to set it up. Like I had to redo adding my wifi and password, all the settings like country, prompts, etc. They made the return process so easy so I’ll give them props for that! Just got the “exchange” item. IT’S THE SAME EXACT PHONE I SENT BACK! I know because I recognize the small set of scuffs in the top right hand corner. They asked if I wanted the same color and I specified if it was available or I’d even take a white if it was a better option. They just replaced the little back sticker that came off when I had to clean it the first time I received it because it arrived dirty( like how phones get when they’ve been on a case for a while and the random dust/gunk that kind of accumulates) and added a fancy gold charging cord instead of the play white one. For paying over $400 for a renewed phone like this one I’d say OVERPRICED. They should base their prices off of how the phone looks and not just charge the same for all phones. I can say I’m disappointed to say the very least. The battery life is 86%.  The renewed iPhone 8plus I ordered 2 years ago (from somewhere similar) came at 97% battery life. That’s why I had high hopes it would be fine to order renewed.Will not order from again when the time comes to get a different phone. I’ve learned my lesson.', '  I had been looking at Amazon renewed iPhones for a couple of weeks but was skeptical about ordering a renewed phone. I decided on an iPhone XR and saw this iPhone 11 for about $30 more and put it in my cart and procrastinated ordering it for a couple of hours partly because there were no reviews at the time. I decided to go for it since it could be sent back. I checked the tracking info the day it was suppose to be delivered and saw the review posted the day before and became very concerned I had made a bad decision and was prepared for disappointment when it arrived. The battery was completely dead and when I put it on the charger it didn’t look like it was charging at all and that concerned me but after 30 minutes it had enough battery to power on. I haven’t had any issues so far, and it’s just as good as if I had bought it brand new. There are no cosmetic flaws anywhere on it. Very pleased with it so far!', '  It was perfect!

UNTIL it's held at an angle.  See video clip of how rippled / warbled the screen was - obviously a non-OEM quality replacement job.  And likely a poorly completed job by the seller.when applying screen protector(s) it became horribly noticeable - the protector couldn't fully adhere, leaving bubbles that couldn't rub out because the underlying screen wasn't smooth.  Disaster - waste of 2 protectors.Sad part - this was our 2nd refurb phone, the first had the original glass - but was pretty scratched up.  Not worth $500 as a refurb.  Returned, purchased from a different seller.  Lesson learned - just spend $50 more and buy it new from Apple.com\", '  i desperately needed a new phone. my phone was starting to give out not only because my old phone was outdated (iPhone 7+), but it was starting to have so many problems. trust me, i did so much research and looking up what type of new phone i should get. i looked for months on end while my old phone was still in good condition. the iPhone 11 was honestly the best purchase i got, it’s so new and improved that i don’t ever wanna switch back to Samsung. i’ve gotten used to the no home button that when i first got it, i didn’t know how to use it😂best part was that i got the iPhone 11 unlocked and it works with my straight talk so i’m pretty pumped about that.thank you!!', '  it seemed like new the thing I didn’t like is was it wasn’t in its original boxing didn’t even last three months and the screen started bugging out since it’s refurbished and the seller won’t help me by swapping it or giving you a refund. I’m mad and upset 700$ for a busted iPhone 11 what a rip off:( don’t buy this product as it’s just a broken phone. Better off buying a new one. They won’t even swap or anything. Like I just want a full refund n to send it back:( very unpleasant', '  The iPhone 11 my son bought from BuySPRY technically works in the sense of being a very expensive digital camera and ipod, but not as a phone.  In august, we were contacted by our phone service provider Xfinity Mobile who said the phone was flagged for being from Asia, possibly counterfeit, and therefore unusable on their system.  Checking with Verizon, ATT, and T-Mobile with IMEI, the answer was the same - nobody wants this phone on their system.  We contact BuySPRY who asked for the IMEI, which I immediately sent, and they have ghosted us since. We are now out of the return window, and my son has wasted his money.', '  All is great with the phone! Came in two days. It was a great upgrade from my 8 plus, very adorable and was delivered to my door in two days conveniently instead of waiting in a Apple store like usual! Will buy again from amazon.', \"  Keep in mind these items are refurbished, which means someone else has had them - it may have a screen cover or already have knicks and chips. Based on my experience - there's a huge chance it could have been opened and repaired. If the phone was opened and the water resistant seal wasn't sealed correctly - you may lose the water resistant rating that these phones should have. There's a small chance of that happening, but it could still happen. Good thing - you have an extended 90 day return policy when it comes to Amazon refurbished returns.If Amazon offered unlocked, new phones - I would go that route - unfortunately they don't.\", '  I received the purple iPhone 11 in perfect shape! No scratches or cracks, it’s beautiful! Upgraded from the iPhone 7 Plus and this has been a wonderful transition. Easy to transfer info from iPhone to iPhone, too. Quick shipping, received a day early! Would not hesitate to buy used from them again!!', \"  What an awful, frustrating month long experience. Save yourself a ton of grief and aggravation and do not buy a phone here!! This whole experience was tragic. The phone was an absolute complete and total piece of worthless junk. The key board didn't work, it constantly froze up, it muted itself whenever it felt like it. I initiated a return process after the hassle of importing everything onto it then having to reverse the process when I realized the phone was possessed. I contacted the company and their big solution was to have me take the phone to a local repair shop like it was a pair of shoes and get an estimate for repairs, send them said estimate and they would then reimburse for the repair cost if the estimate was to their liking.NO WAY!! Ludacris, absurd solution! I finally had to get Amazon customer service involved, 6 phone calls over the span of a week and they were nice about it but I had to drive the phone 45 minutes to a UPS drop off spot after that and finally got a refund but not for the full price paid so I had to call Amazon AGIAN to get it fully rectified. Even the Amazon representative said this was a totally bogus response and proposed solution from the seller and to not buy 3rd party seller items in future. Lesson learned! Don't waste your time with this company. they sell you junk and make it as hard as possible to return for a refund. one month out and I still don't have a phone. Waiting till Black Friday at this point and buying new.\", '  Speakers are blown and very crackly. Cannot hear it is so bad.', '  I purchased the phone but when I took it to T-Mobil the device wouldn’t allow them to activate it. T-Mobil spoke with the customer care person from the seller but they couldn’t get it to work. So they told me to send it back.

After they receive the device they will credit me.I ended up buying a NEW one unopened and unused by T-Mobil for $599. Yeah it was $113 more but it is unused AND THIS TIME IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!! They should at least guarantee me another one at that price or at the very least do something for my troubles. The customer care person was nice and polite. But reiterated that there was nothing he can do and this happens. Unfortunately I wouldn’t recommend this company. But new or from Amazon’s renew store. They at least stand by there products and guarantee satisfaction.', '  It’s in perfect condition. Arrived with charging cable. No earphones but the description said it didn’t include them. Great purchase and currently using it to write this review.', '  Phone was in great condition except the screen. Screen has noticeable damage and deep scratches.

Emails seemed to just go in circles instead of saying ok sorry here is a label. Now of course they aren’t open on weekends so I am out $700 and a phone even longer now! Not appreciating this at all.

Called Amazon and got replacement ordered right away no problem with Amazon Renewed guarantee.Second iPhone comes and literally the same scratched area on this one too. If I didn’t know better, I would have thought they were the same phone based on the scratched area. I decided to put on a screen protector and see if that minimized the scratches, which it did.I believe the scratches are part of the refurb process or something, but would really have preferred the seller to have done better QC. I didn’t want to send back another time so I kept the phone. Because of that, I give 3 stars. Good price and responsive seller and Amazon was good to work with, but my wife’s phone from another seller didn’t have the screen scratch issue I did.Battery life seems good and no other issues with the phone. I feel like a scratched screen is kinda a big deal though since the screen is the phone basically.

When setting up my phone one of the first things I noticed was how loud the sound was, sound quality was off too. I had my audio low and on mute and notification rings were still loud. Then I got my first phone call and that’s I become disappointed. It was difficult to hear and understand the other person the phone, I had to switch to speaker to listen. It sounds staticky like if it weren’t plugged in correctly or if speakers were in the wrong place.

The gift cards helped defray the cost. She got what she wanted in perfect condition. I purchased the warranty for extra protection and we took it to Metro PCS by T-Mobile and they set it up without a hitch. I will use the Renewed program again.

Mines came fully unlocked working no scratches or cracks.. Stellar phone In general', '  Perfect phone. Looks like new. Unlocked. No scratches at all. It looks like I just got it on an apple store. Ty. I am VERY HAPPY with my phone', '  I love ittttt! I was a little skeptical at first, but I love this phone! It came with a charger, and it came in a day early!', \"  I Love This Phone To Be a Renewed Phone It's Awesome. For Almost $700 it's A Great Buy.\", '  My phone was delivered before the promised date, well packaged and just what I ordered. I have since set it up and it is running magnificently. I absolutely am so delighted with my phone', '  the phone worked well, but the face recognition did not work. I tried everything, but nothing and I had to send my phone to amazon to get my money back and I was left without phone for a couple of days.', \"  Please don't waste your money. This phone is a POS and was definitely tampered with in a malicious manner before being sold. After many months of owning this device here is my review:Pros:Works like a normal iPhone (for the most part until it doesnt after a few months)Main camera seems to be real and works good (surprisingly)The operating system works perfectly so farCons:Came in sketchy 3rd party phone box with 3rd party chargerTrue Depth Camera for Face ID was completely removed and replaced with a fake one.Volume very frequently bugs out and becomes quiet until you mess with it and goes back to normal then does the same thing over and over.Wifi & Cellular connection is really bad I frequently have to restart the device numerous times to make it connect to the internet again.Update: Phone has completely stopped working when under 50% battery and Screen is popping out of place on the left side.In Conclusion this phone is one of the biggest wastes of money I’ve ever spent. DO NOT BUY REFURBISHED PHONES ON AMAZON! I will revisit this review as more problems with this device very likely occur.\", '  Good', \"  Hi everyone. This phone is the biggest amazon purchase I've made and I don't regret it! I was hesitant at first after reading some horrible reviews about other phones online, but this hasn't disappointed me yet. The phone arrived in excellent condition- like brand new. Ive had it almost 2 weeks now and I've had ZERO issues. I bought a separate case and screen protector - I've dropped it several times already (i'm clumsy) and it still held up great. No issues with the touch screen. The battery life is amazing!!!! If you have doubts, I hope my review helps you seal the deal :)\", '  ( 62  days old) bright light on bottom  pages disappears, phone freezes,  s amazon told seller to send another one. Been waiting 3 months seller keeps on refusing.  Amazon promised me that they will talk to him and I will get another one. Called 4 times since April.  I would  never buy from this seller again. Only amazon direct where they have  control  Also the phone gets very very hot and can not hold a charge for  long time  battery wears down fast', '  Absolutely amazing and so glad I made this decision! Definitely worth every penny', '  Phone came in amazing shape. It didn’t come in it’s original Apple box which is fine and it didn’t come with the original apple charger which is also okay! It still came with a nice lengthy charger regardless. The phone has 100% battery capacity and it had absolutely no dents or scratches on it.', '  So I was very skeptical only because this would be my second purchase through amazon . The first time was ordering for my mother in law and it turned out fine for her , physically flawless phone with great battery life. For me on the other hand the battery life was disappointing and I feel like the speakers are bit off like it was renewed from water damage possibly. Also the phone wasn’t all the way unlocked . Though I can use it fine and my SIM card works , for some reason it won’t fully register with my provider online and when I chatted with an agent through Verizon they said my phone was non-Verizon device and they were unable to unlock it which again begs the question is it truly unlocked? Or was there a loophole and I can still use it properly with no problem. Will be returning only because the storage is not enough in comparison to my old phone but I’ve read that it’s a hit or miss when returning these phone so wish me luck !', \"                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0The screen on the left side was sometimes not recognizing my touch, which leads me to look closely at the device and it looks like it's a damaged piece that was repaired.  The device was warded off, looked to be overused,  Camera has scratches and frame dents, mute knob some times does not mute the piece.There are better-refurbished devices for the same price, this one looks to be totally repaired.\", '  I bought this phone the first time over a month ago. When I unboxed it, the keyboard did not work and I couldn\\'t even get past setup. On the second phone, the screen flickered every time I pressed a button. The only good thing I can say is that the return process was easy. These are not \"certified\". They have been checked for physical damage and that is all.', '  My first Apple product since the ipod.  Which still works BTW.  I suffered through a whole series of android phones.  Had issues with them.  Calls dropped, bad reception.  Calls I was waiting for going directly to voicemail.  I blamed my carrier and I was wrong.  It was the phones.Easy to use.  Better texting/fast fewer mistakes.  More intuitive.  So simple to pair accessories.  Just works effortlessly.  I have excellent reception and the phone works all the time.  It is reliable and it seems sturdy, not cheap.  I am now an Apple person.  My next computer will be Apple too.  I am done fighting with technology.  I want it to work for me and Apple does that.', '  I was very skeptical about buying a renewed  iphone. The phone arrived like a brand new iPhone, not a single dent or scratch and it has been working perfectly', '  Before buying I specifically selected \"unlocked\" when prompted to select a carrier. After hours of trying to activate and switch over my service, I spent another hour on the phone with my provider only to find out that the phone was locked. Then to make matter worse the phone would not allow me to log into the app store, or transfer my data over. I\\'ll most likely return the phone because I am so angry about everything that I just went through. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It\\'s a hassle and a half and you\\'re most likely going to have to return it too.', '  The phone should be water proof but after putting the phone in water it shut off. Extremely disappointed.', '  I love this so much ! The vendor was one of the only ones who had yellow iPhones available at a good price. I just upgraded from a iPhone 8 that I had for less then a week due to it size. Now this is everything I wanted and more. I love yellow lol. Also I was so happy to see there was a screen protector already in my phone. Like really? That’s a win. I now have 4 extras just in case . It’s also a lot faster then my iPhone 8 and transferring my stuff  was eAsy.', '  Good phone for the price', '  Absolutely wonderful product. Bought refurbished from Amazon warehouse. Looks and performs as brand new. Fantastic. The product arrived one day earlier than promised.', '  I was pretty worried about getting a refurbished phone off of amazon but this is definitely worth the buy! It doesn’t come in the Apple box or has earphones but the phone is in amazing condition! It looks brand new and has full battery capacity but also it comes with A tempered glass screen protector on the phone!', '  The phone came without a scratch.  Easy to set up.  Everything works.', \"  Buyer beware... be very careful buying these refurbished phones. I received mine which was supposed to be able to be used on T-Mobile's network. I took it into the store to link it to my plan and was informed that it could not be used because it is currently registered to another user.  So it either was not wiped clean or was stolen. Returned and received a refund.\", '  I’m so thankful Amazon offers the phone refurbished. I’m not spending $150 a month with leases and payments to these phone companies. With a family of seven and kids that want to keep up with the Joneses. Verizon offers a prepaid plan unlimited everything for $35. That’s right for $35 a month draft it out of your debit card or go in the store and pay. If you have your own phone you get the same service as I paid $150 a month for for $35. I cannot do that if Amazon did not offer these refurbished phones. Thanks to Amazon and thanks to whoever is refurbishing these phones. Please take my advice,Switch to prepaid and buy yourself a pair of shoes every month with the savings', \"  I bought this phone for $700 a couple of months after Apple released the iPhone 11.  This phone worked right for maybe 4-5 months. Now every 30 minutes it disables because the temperature is too hot. My phone loses connection every 30 minutes no matter how important I am in need of my phone to make calls, it loses service. I have service with straight talk. I have for years, as soon as I put this phone on their Phone service, it automatically started to give me problems. Straight talk has never led me to have issues but if you buy a phone from Electronic Deals from Amazon you'll definitely wind up with a whole lot of problems and wasted money.\", '  So far so good, I have only had the phone a few days, the delivery process went smoothly. The phone did look fairly new the only give away was that it did not come in the apple box and I did not receive an original apple charger to use with it, but I purchased my own. For the price I feel like I did get a good deal, definitely better than paying over a thousand just for the original box and charger and earbuds, I believe that is all I’m missing. The phone did appear unlocked, I use AT&T and it works fine with it.', '                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0The phone keeps on turning off and on over and over on its own when I open an app it keeps turning off and on over and over. Not worth buying. Returning the phone', '  If there is ever a phone I was ever so pleased with, it’s this one. I got it during quarantine time because I had accidentally put my old phone in the washer. Anyway, this phone is excellent for a refurbished. From face recognition, battery life span, camera quality, storage, I wouldn’t ask for a better phone. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to but iPhone 11 for an affordable price, one year now and my phone is still intact. Bought another one for my brother and he was not disappointed. I also got them in their apple packaging with accessories which is unbelievable because I thought I wouldn’t by the comments. 10 stars, get you this phone.', '  Honestly it was because of the reviews why I trusted the seller. And it was worth it. Can’t complain no scratches no damage no issues what so ever. I wild recommend anyone to them. I use metro pcs as my carrier and they do support this phone. Plus I get to keep my bill low. Win win.', '  Excellent condition, like new. Very happy with it so far.', \"  After having this iphone 11 for just 3 days, I've come to realize that there are issues with the phone that were not addressed before it was sent to me. After fully resetting and updating the phone, checking the sim card with my service provider, and even taking it to multiple phone repair shops to have it checked... The phone still completely restarts without any warning up to 10 times in an hour. The device also seems to have some screen sensitivity issues and sometimes it will not respond to touch for several moments before working. On top of that, this phone hasn't been able to locate any of the bluetooth devices in my home that other members of the household are easily able to connect to.I honestly don't know what went wrong here considering all the other good reviews, but let's just say you're definitely taking a chance if you buy a refurbished phone. I guess I'm going to have to send this one in for a refund... an unfortunate waste of time.\", '  I love it so much!! Definitely an upgrade for sure i had the iPhone 8 previously ! It was about $100 cheaper than the apple website!! A few people mentioned in there reviews that they received a screen protector with there phone but i did not, it did come with a charger, the block for it!! I am very satisfied I didn’t have to call my phone company either to have the phones/ sim card switched it did that all its self which i love, it made the process so much easier!! I did go ahead an buy a case & protector & that was the part that got me most i could buy phone case & protector along with the phone & it was still under what apple was trying to sell it for! Thank you amazon P.s. no cracks, dents, or scratches that i can see! Also came early!!', \"  I received the phone two weeks ago and I was a little nervous after some of the reviews I've read about renewed phone. It came in a generic box and the phone was inside a bubble wrap package. I quickly inspected the phone and it was perfect. It looks practically brand new. It also came with free screen.  Booted the phone and completed the setup. Phone works great so far! Will keep everyone posted if anything change.\", '  Very nice It’s not a scam', '  Purchased this only to have the speaker go out in 4 months ( fitting since the seller \"warranty\" window is 3 months).  Took it to best buy and they wouldn\\'t work on it because it is an international version.  Now I have to either pay $600 to fix a non-us version or but a new one.  I knew 8 was taking a chance on a \"renewed\" device, but this is ridiculous.  Worst decision ever buying this one.Word of advice, when buying a phone, verify with the serial number that it is in fact the correct version.', '  I purchased the black iPhone 11 and it came in with no scratches or dents in the phone. The screen was also flawless. The battery percent was at 100%. I am satisfied with my purchase and would definitely buy from BuySpry again!! Also this is my second amazon refurbished phone purchase. 10/10 would recommend', \"  I bought the phone refurbished and upon receipt I took it to tmobile to start service and the phone was blacklisted and reported stolen by the owner. I couldn't believe it.\", '  First This phone is not unlocked, so that is a lie, it will no work with Verizon, and then it is shipped with fedex! FedEx is not reliable! The phone was supposed to be here 2 weeks ago, still a not here! Just buy a new phone and save yourself a lot of time. It is not worth the few bucks you save buying this one!', '  This phone came in only two days. The phone came with a sturdy charger and charging box. The phone also came with a glass screen protector on it which I REALLY appreciate bc I can NEVER get mine on perfectly. This one is on PERFECTLY. the battery life was at 100%. In perfect condition. Even came w ab 80% battery.', '  After a delay of two weeks of receiving the phone, and after getting it set up at my Verizon store, the battery lasted one month!  My Apple store told me it would take 5 days to get a new battery for the phone. I was so exasperated that I would be without a phone for that long I traded it in and bought the 12pro. Never again will I buy a refurbished phone! This really cost me.', '  The phone is very nice looking and it was so easy to set up the phone. It took no time to set up phone and for all my stuff to show back up on here. I suggest that if u have a phone u should do the trade in option like i did because you can get money off the phone. Only problem I had is thatthe phone wasn’t updated and I had to wait an hour to update the phone. But other than that overall nice phone! The seller was super nice btw and very helpful :) I will do a one month update on this phone so watch out for that. (I’ve had it for a week now)Update :Phone really isn’t unlocked to all carriers but overall the phone is ok ig. It’s it works only with cdma networks 🤦🏽\\u200d♀️ Not happy', '  When arrived, battery life was already at 80%. My husband has had this same phone for two years and he’s still in the 90’s. After researching, I was able to get the same phone for very close to the same price at the Apple store near me and it was brand new.  The refund process was fairly easy though.', '  Brand new phone, are at least it was supposed to be. The screen came scratched! The company place a screen protector over the top to hide, so sent it out damaged in the first place. Very disappointed in the large purchase and already damaged!!', '  Came in time was wrapped very good It is a great phone Im enjoying it very much', \"  It didn't work out of the box. The number 8 wouldn't work and the downloading of software from the old phone had to be restarted 3 times. Returned it. Bought a 10 refurbished from iPhone.

I thought I am saving $80 dollars by getting a nice like new product but was very disappointed. Packaging was done by a 3-4 years old for sure. whoever think this junk is in new condition need to have their eyes checked. Total waste of time.', '  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.  Purchased a refurbished iPhone 11 and it never connected to cell service correctly until eventually it stopped working altogether.  I got a new SIM card and still nothing.

Do not trust that they will sell you a working product.  Buyer beware', '  After a three year hiatus of wanting another phone from the iPhone 6plus which by the way was a replacement from my 8plus at the time … yea I know you all like what the … lol yes times was hard lol came across this phone read the reviews and since I’ve purchased online in the past I’m like why not shipping was like less then 48 hrs! Phone arrived without original packaging but they did a great job package that once it get to you it’s in a safe condition! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PHONE!!! Battery life greAt! The speaker sound is Amazing! But the Camera’s!!!!!!! Take the cake all the way home! I feel like a realPhotographer! Lol I be ready to go to nature trails etc! This is definitely a GREAT BUY for an FANTASTIC price!!! 👌🏽', '  So far I’m very pleased with the iPhone 11 I received. I purchased an AT&T locked phone because it was cheaper and I’ve had so many bad experiencing buying “unlocked” phones in the past that aren’t unlocked.Anyway, I’m upgrading from an old iPhone 6s so by comparison everything seems super sleek and nice. My refurbished phone came to me undamaged and I did not find any nicks or scratches on it, it essentially looks brand new. Battery life seems amazing. The seller even put a screen protector on it, which was a super nice touch and I was not expecting it.', '  After a month or so the phone is horrible. Turns off all the time randomly. Amazon customer support has been useless as they tell me I have to take the phone to the apple store. I just want to send it back and go to my phone carrier and pay the extra for a phone that ACTUALLY works. I bought two of these and the other one is the exact same issues.Update: took both phones to apple and they’re both listed as MFG date for the year 1978. Apple said these phones were supposed to be sent back to apple for repairs and never made it and was “re-sold” to me. Returning them as we speak to hopefully get a return 😑']\n",

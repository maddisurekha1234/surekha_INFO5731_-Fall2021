            "$$$$$  review_whole_text $$$$ [\"  I've read all of the predominant machine learning related python books and this one is by far the best one. I was excited to see the second edition of this book come out. It is packed with new information (1.5x the length of the first edition) and updated for TensorFlow 2. I have the Kindle edition and find it very helpful to highlight key points. I look forward to receiving the print edition as well once it is released.EDIT: Just received the print edition of the book and it's in color! The first edition wasn't. This is a pleasant surprise as it makes it easier to read with various charts and graphics.\", '  This book gives you a hands-on approach to learning by doing. As opposed to the trendy deep learning books that dive deep into the weeds from the start, this book starts with the more traditional ML approaches (the Scikit-learn part) giving you a great deal of context and practical tools for solving all kinds of problems. Only after does he transition into deep learning concepts, giving you both a great overview and the background to understand when and where to apply the various techniques. Its code-focused so you\\'ll have the option to run working code on real problems throughout the book.Most important for me, he focuses on explanation over hand-wavy equations that are rampant in other ML books. I say hand-wavy because they typically go like so: \"Here\\'s a hard concept. Rather than explain it well, I\\'ll give you some linear algebra and calculus equations, remind you that this is stuff you should have learned in high school, and then move on.\" Authors probably feel justified in doing this, but after reading a book like this you understand what they are really doing: Skipping the hard-part of breaking difficult concepts down into chunks that can be consumed by a competent programmer, who is perhaps not an expert in \"high school\" math. Moreover, this author does so without dumbing down the content.  That\\'s the mark of someone who well understands both the content and the audience.This book is long and dense, and serves as both a guide and a reference. It is not a quick read / overview or light reading type book.', \"  While I enjoy learning from this book, the math font in kindle edition is a mess which makes the reading unpleasant. I know to some this probably shouldn't be a deal breaker but for someone who wants to move from hard copy to kindle, it was a disappointment.\", \"  This is an update for my previous review.Recently, I gave one star for the poor ebook experience but with author's comment I realized the publisher updated the ebook and now everything is great in the ebook.As the name suggests, the book gives you a really hands-on experience on machine learning. This covers most of the recent main advancements in the field.\", \"  I'm very pleased with this book. I enjoy the little bits of humor here and there, and it does a great job not glossing over important details that might be a stumbling block for someone. I'm quite comfortable with python however I appreciated that he did go into depth on setting up virtual environments and best practices. I remember years back when I was starting that whole concept tripped me up so much, having this explained so well is going to save someone a lot of time. Also his code seems so far to be written in a very thoughtful way and has them all on github. He also goes into lots of gotchas and tips and tricks that just overall seem to add a certain maturity to his writing. He has obviously very well versed in machine learning.Overall I would recommend. It's been much more interesting than I expected.\", '  Aurelien did it again!Whether you are a data scientist looking to start building predictive models in Python, or a software developer looking to become an ML engineer, look no further!The excellent balance between theory/background and implementation that was present in the first edition is kept, with the essential material additions made (e.g. the unsupervised learning in the \"classical ML\" part, or the Keras API, which is quickly becoming the most popular way to use TensorFlow).Needless to say, the Jupyter notes accompanying each chapter are more than helpful.Also, as a cherry on top, the illustrations in the printed version are now in color, which makes it even easier to read.In summary, this book is an absolute must-have for a Python-rooted data scientist  / ML engineer!', \"  I'm finishing up an MCS in Data Science from UIUC and I can tell you bar none that this book should be required reading in this subject. The required ML course at school was so confusing and they assumed WAY too much. Reading over the same topics in this book was like night and day in terms of explaining things in a way that makes sense. The images, graphs, and tables are clear and help a lot by providing visuals to the text explanation. I did notice a few typos but so far nothing critical. This is not a light read as it comes in at almost 800 pages but taking it model-by-model is easy to do.\", \"  The book was worth the wait!  The publication quality of the print edition is great.  Love the color illustrations.  The one thing that I miss is that having bought the print edition, it would be sweet to have an offer to acquire the electronic edition at a reduced price but since Amazon now seems to be handling O'Reilly book sales and probably wants to sell as many Kindle editions as possible, a PDF copy of Hands-On Machine Learning, 2nd Ed., does not seem to be in my future at a bargain price.  My review is preliminary - I've read bits of the online draft version-and the clarity and superb organization of Géron's writing convinced me that I wanted a finished copy of the book.  My current avocational interest is Reinforcement Learning and Géron gives an excellent overview - to dive deep, one would probably still want to refer to Sutton & Barto's 2nd Ed. book (available on Amazon or for free online) or David Silver's excellent 2015 UCL lectures, also available online..  I will slowly work my way through Géron's book in its entirety but my primary reason for owning the book is as a reference.  It makes a great roadmap to the current state of machine learning and, best of all, it makes learning about ML fun!\", '  This is the third book I\\'ve bought from this guy and every single time on the first coding example(and other examples) there are codes missing or he doesn\\'t add codes that he has already spoken about, unlike the other books where he constantly repeats the same thing over and over but for some reason can seem to repeat the code. Sometimes he just forgets to put in a line of code.This book is free online I learned that after googling for the right code but still I prefer buying the book. Even so, he should really have someone else check his work. unlike the other books, he keeps up with where he puts his \"imports\" and \"from\" codes in his other books it was always where he starts using it which is bad coding those codes should be put at the top of all the line of codes for ease of finding and it was well structured for that I will give it three stars.Despite, having to look for missing code I did enjoy this book it did help to have resources from his other books. This isn\\'t really a surprise because I\\'ve done it in college, but I did not expect to do it in the first example from a well-known author.If you\\'re thinking of getting the book get it but only if you plan on using other resources that is if you are completely new to coding. I would like to add if it wasn\\'t for StackOverflow and his community on GitHub I would have given it a one star. Just know once you get the code working you get the biggest satisfaction and you will keep pressing on. Good luck during this pandemic coders', '  The Tokyo Olympics of 2020 got postponed to 2021. If there were a contest for best AI/ML book at the Olympics this year this book would have earned the gold medal ! I loved it so much that I read it at least twice, and each time I underlined/highlighted/took-notes. I love how lucidly the author explains concepts. He does an excellent job of explaining topics such as the model, the learning algorithm (also called the optimization algorithm), regularization hyperparameter, generalization etc. The examples are great and even if one does not know python programming it is easy to follow along. (I learned python a few months later, which made it even easier and more interesting to follow the examples in this and other books). While no one single book can teach one ML/AI, this book would make the Mount Rushmore of AI/ML books (along with (1) Intro to Statistical Learning by Hastie etc (2) Intro to Machine Learning by Alpaydin (3) Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio etc). I highly recommend this book to anyone aspiring to get into the field of ML/AI.', '  pros:- paper and overall qualitycons:- right pages are printed with a slight disalignment, it’s not a big of a deal, but a little annoying. See attached pictures', '  -I\\'ve already spent several tens of hours with this book. The Kindle version is (I consider) overly expensive considering the number of issues.-Many of the notebooks and/or book code examples do not work and/or take inordinate amounts of time to compute.-I can\\'t count the number of times I\\'ve already had to go off and spend an hour or more updating or changingcode so that it works, whether it be from the book or from the latest notebooks (which the author claims tokeep up to date).-Explanations are often poor. For instance, when discussing false positives, false negatives, etc... He could havejust put all definitions in one place, like on wikipedia, but instead he tries to \"word\" everything out. It\\'s not a very methodical way of instruction.-Another python book with so many breaking inter-dependencies that it boggles the mind - yet the author implies that \"from the ground up\" solutions are just \"toys.\" Well, at least those toys will not break down when some part of your byzantine collection of libraries is updated.', '  I am only in the early chapters so far, but I noticed that it is very well written.  It helps that this is a 2nd edition.  ML concepts are not easy to explain clearly, so the author has done a fine job.  Part 2 deep learning seems totally new to the 2nd edition.  I was mostly interested in deep learning and was almost going to skip part 1, but am glad I didn’t.  I am getting a concise review of basic ML in part 1.Re Kindle version, I am happy to report that the formatting works well.  Code is easy to read and math formulas show up well.  There is also color in graphs.  O’Reilly print books are only in black and white and some graphs can’t be read because all lines or dots are the same black color.  No problem here.  I was able to get Alexa to read the book to me in a very realistic voice.  I used iPad pro, installed Alexa app on it, then from the Alexa app, I opened the Kindle book, choose chapter, and pressed play.  Alexa correctly pronounced scikit-learn, which is an achievement.  Speech engine seems much improved and sounds very good.  Connected a bluetooth headset. forward, back, pause, resume buttons on headset works.', \"  The book begins with a short general discussion of machine learning, including data preparation, visualization, splitting into train and test sets, model fitting, and evaluation.The bulk of the book focuses on the techniques that are the current state-of-the-art -- ensembles and particularly deep learning.  There is enough math to be convincing, but not so much to distract from practical applications.  The sections describing deep learning architectures are particularly well done.Throughout the book, clear illustrations and fully disclosed Python 3 code enable the reader to replicate the author's work.\", \"  This is the best book you can buy if you want to implement machine learning to your project.What I really like about this is a book is that the author knows how to explain ML concepts by solving a real-world example problem, as opposed to just explaining the theory.Strong MATH knowledge isn't required to understand this book(just the basic and you can learn the concept as you go), however, strong programming knowledge is required based on my personal experience.\", '  I am only about to start with chapter 4 but if the rest of the book is of the same quality as the first few chapters then it definitely deserves 5 stars.  The title of the book covers the content, and the book comes loaded with practical advice as well as working code samples.  In fact is comes with complete projects in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.  You really cannot go wrong buying this book, certainly given the price.  Even if there are some chapters you end up liking less then it\\'s still worth the money.One heads up is that it\\'s not an easy read.  That is partly because of the nature of the material, and partly because the author thankfully goes into the technical details of the what and how (and does so in a very accessible way).  There is no \"handwaving\"!  As a result the text is a bit dense and it can make for slow reading, but on the other hand it then leaves you with the satisfaction of a rather good understanding of the topic.One more thing - it probably does not hurt to be well versed in Pandas, especially matrix-wide operations in a single line of code.', '  I’ve been kicking the ML learning can down the road for a while now. I’ve bought books in the past, but nothing really stuck as they get crazy theoretical by page 4. This book assumes very little ML knowledge, which describes me perfectly. Bought this book and can’t put it down. I’m on page 47 and keep peeking ahead to see what’s next. Best technical book I have purchased  in many many years. Looking through all the content it amazes me how someone could present ALL this info in a format I get. Love it, totally recommend it. Thank you for this.', '  I bought the book from vendor Globalmart Online Shop, quality is very bad. Pages are cheap, looks like a printed copy, not original text book. I bought book from amazon (same version) first time around June this year (spoiled due to pet) is very good in terms of quality. Thickness and color of pages are very different and page alignment is different as well. I did put exchange of the book, if I get the same quality again, I will make sure to attach the photos and complain to Amazon on this vendor for cheating.', '  If you are looking to learning more about Data Science I highly recommend this book. The only stipulation is that if you have not used math or statistics for a couple years that you read \"Practical Statistics for Data Scientists\" first, or you may be a little lost. While this is an introduction to Machine Learning, it is not an introduction to Python, Linear Algebra, Calculus, or Statistics. You can still follow along with the code and science explanations, but if you are novice in math or programming just be ready to spend a couple hours researching a single paragraph from this book. This is not a bad thing and actually a strength of this book. Once you understand the fundamental concepts, the author concisely and accurately shows you how to implement the model.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!', '  This book is a gem! I have read many textbooks and this is one of those books that is interesting, informative and well structured and includes so many great details. The book is meant more for practitioners but there is still enough math and lots of references to papers if the reader wants more theoretical information. I would recommend this book to anyone whether you are an undergrad or a PhD with several years of experience. Truly a well written book ! Thank you Aurelion !', \"  A nice educational, very well written and up to date overview of machine learning techniques + tons of practical and well documented code in python that can be used straight out of the box. Lot's of stuff is in there. A lot of the of the book is spent on neural networks including the latest and greatest varieties. Just check out the table of context.There are tons of high quality and informative graphics in the book, all in color, plus colored syntax highlighting. So far i have not seen any other book with colored syntax highlighting.\", '  This is an excellent book for an introduction to Keras and Tensorflow. It complements the Coursera Tensorflow course and the tutorials on the Tensorflow website very well.At first, I didn’t appreciate that the first half of the book is devoted to machine learning. But after reading that part, I learnt many new tricks/shortcuts. For example, how easy it is to do stratified shuffle spits to balance out the training and test samples and creating pipelines. The book also reenforces a process for ML, which I really liked.The deep learning part of the book is excellent as well. It has the right balance between theory and practical ways to use Tensorflow.Having the code available on Github is very helpful.The book is easy to read and to understand (a fairly complex topic). It is an invaluable resource!', \"  I've read about 90 pages and am impressed by thoroughly various topics are covered. You can eventually learn all of this by reading multiple other books but it is much better to have all of the info well- organized in one place. I am not  a subject matter expert but so far I like this book much better than the  Manning series which I have bought several of.\", \"  This book has not aged well.  I'm writing this review in July of 2021.  Half of the code no longer compiles, or throws run-time exceptions and warnings.  Worse, the book is no longer popular enough to make the errors that it throws significant enough to return in searches on GitHub issues, StackOverflow, or other troubleshooting websites.  The most you can hope from this book is an introduction to the fundamentals of Machine Learning.  Everything else is too dated to be of any use.\", '  I took a machine learning graduate course in my master program. I had a top conference paper. The professor used 1st edition of this book as one textbook for the course. I had a 1st edition of the book but did not have time to read. Now I buy the 2nd edition because the Tensorflow  2 has merged with Keras, which means we can avoid to learn the hard syntax of tensorflow 1.0, and there are a lot of new advances in machine learning, such as generative models. Also to my surprise, the book is colorful. That makes the book is more interesting.Each chapter has summary of math. That is better than some programming machine learning books that do not have any math. If you have some backgrounds in math of machine learning, this book can save you time because it gives you the whole picture without lost. If you are very interested in some equations and want to derive them, you can use Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book.The Github has a lot of python projects of machine learning. The codes are well-written. If you can write codes like the codes in the projects, you will have the potential to enter Google.Go Google, the book is a must have.', \"  I'm currently getting my MS in health data science and this was the book we had to get for my machine learning class. I was annoyed when the teacher said the class would be textbook heavy and he was only going lecture on high level concepts, I thought there was no way textbook would be able to a carry a class and boy was I wrong. This is hands down the best textbook I've ever bought! I never expected a data science text book to be easy to read but this book flows so well!, its easily digestible and it gives great examples with data that is easily available. You can write completely functional ML code from this book alone but one of the best features is that the book has GitHub site broken down chapter by chapter that helps fill the code out. If you are someone like me who hadn't had any experience with Matplotlib the github was super helpful because it covers in depth how to make really nice plots for the various models. I would recommend this book to anyone who is doing machine learning. The only thing I would change about this book is when it gets into decision trees, RF, various boosting types, XGB, as it moves through the models it only gives an example of the classification form of the model or the regression for of the model and I think it would be helpful if it gave examples for both for each model. But with that being said this was a pretty minimal thing I would change and I would still buy the book again even if they didn't change it! It's definitely worth the money!\", \"  I am using the kindle app on my ipad to view this book. However, some of the equations are just very unattractive due to the sizing issues... I gave up and decided to go back to a physical book. It would be great if this is fixed... Other people have also voiced similar concerns back last year and it's still not fixed\", '  After a delay in my shipment and opening the package, I am extremely disappointed. I really was excited to read this book too, but I can\\'t.The quality of the book is not new. It looks used, beaten and some of the pages are not even binded, heck some of the pages are not even printed! It looks like someone even cut one of the edges somehow when failing to bind the page. It looks like someone noticed how trash the ink was and tried printing over the old page only to end up making it look worse.I cant even read this, how could someone sell this and think this is \"new\"??', '  I purchased this book a while back before attending a 3-month on-site bootcamp program with a capstone project. After graduating the program and before starting my job as a ML scientist, I found time to read this book and I must say it is an investment worth its price. Even though I had the best teachers in the bootcamp, it was very hands-on and some concepts got lost or rushed due to time constraints. This book is the first reference book that I do not get bored of, it does NOT have a dry language and flows perfectly. I am just reading it and even that suffices; I am sure doing the hand-on exercises will make it better. I now understood theoretical concepts and got a hold on why we used some parameters in a given way. I highly suggest it to everyone who wants to delve into this world.', '  This book is a perfect addition to any theoretical ML  advanced  course  where an instructor can introduce  theoretical math.  concepts of  ML  based on statistical learning or/and optimization theory and use this book as a good set of examples with ready to use well explained codes. Really good job thank you for your book.', '  This is one of the books every good data scientist has to have. Everyone and his mother is calling himself a “Data Scientist” and they have no practical experience, no math background, and no conception of how to use data science. This book solves a lot of those problems or at least you can spot the phonies. It is one of the best data science books ever written.', '  Upgraded from the First Edition to the Second. Great resource for in-depth explanations, or if you use it as a reference \"Cookbook.\" As an added plus, the author posts all his code/examples on GitHub for everyone to access.', '  I would recommend this book as the primary source for machine learning with Python and Tensorflow 2.Pros:  Among all the books on TensorFlow 2 this one is definitely the best. The second part (Neural Networks) goes much deeper into tf.keras than any other textbook I could find.Cons:  Many important details  are either missing or just glossed over. The code samples are riddled with mistakes and typos.', '  Aurélien Géron is a skilled writer and teacher.If statistical analysis is not your thing, Géron walks you through machine learning with clear examples and ample explanations. If you’re an ML wizard, all the equations and TensorFlow code are there.I work with computational linguistics. Géron takes you from the basics of machine translation to the latest in transformer networks.This excellent book is well worth the price.', '  I am a newbie to ML, and have been self learing for last six months from online resources, and always considered a book as I like reading books. Thid is good book, and good exercise. I am on chapter 8 so far and liking it.', '  The content of the book seems pretty good, although I have not gone thoroughly through it. However, the quality of the printing is not satisfactory. In just a quick first inspection I found many blurry pages throughout the book, including figures, and at least 5 pages that were not printed at all, just like that, with the corresponding scripts and pieces of information missing. I tend to buy less books through Amazon day by day, since the quality of books leaves me almost 100% of the times dissapointed.', '  I am new to ML and so pleased to start my journey with this book. The book is well structured, content is great and it is aptly supported by up to date github repo. So far, I have just worked through the first half of it but can’t wait to finish cover to cover. If you want a good grasp on fundamentals, this is a great book to start with. It is by no means a book for beginners only, but a book that would definitely serve as a reference for years of ML journey.', '  I purchased the first edition and enjoyed it so much I wanted to get the revised/expanded second edition when it arrived. This book is already established as a classic in the ML field and belongs on the bookshelf of anyone learning or using ML.', '  Wonderful book! Just what I expected. Very practical, hands-on like the title says. I have the first edition and I don’t regret one single bit buying the second. A must for any machine learning practitioner!', \"  The math in this class could be easier to read since machine learning is so math dependent. I'm lucky that I took a linear algebra class as well as statistics before taking the class or using this textbook, so that makes it much more accessible to me but, imagine that those without any recent math exposure this book will be harder to read. So far it is the only drawback that I have seen.Otherwise this book does a very very good job at explaining the topics and I find it a joy to read.\", '  Compared to other TF related book this one teaches you all the whys instead of just listing the code to do tasks. It would great benefit you when working on your own projects. One thing I want to mention is that starting with Pytorch to see all the autograd in a \"lower-level\" building blocks made it easier for me to understand TF and its usage.

But after seeing dozens of online tutorials all geared towards absolute beginners, and 'code along' projects whereby the work is all but done for you it's refreshing to see a book like this. The information is incredibly thorough, isn't afraid to explain math, and perhaps most importantly this book unleashes you on many challenging open ended exercises in which you will truly be developing and demonstrating your competence with hands on open-ended projects. I'm so tired of learning resources that either have no exercises/projects or only have code along projects completely done for you in advance. This is one of the few sources I've seen that could reasonably make the claim that if you get through the material, and do all the exercises (without cheating and looking at the solutions), you will be well on your way to being competent practitioner of machine learning (if not already there).That said the prerequisites are no joke. You don't absolutely HAVE to understand the math but something is definitely lost if you don't. So you shouldn't be afraid of linear algebra, vector calculus, etc. (as an aside I believe it's one of the bigger problems of the machine learning/data science boom that many learning resources try to avoid math. the reality is that if you mindlessly call functions from libraries and and randomly fiddle with hyperparameters until something clicks, yes you can get some rudimentary results but you won't be as marketable or useful as you would be if you mathematically understood the process). Also this book is NOT for beginners of python. It's going to be very helpful to already have at least a rough understanding of classes, subclasses, object oriented programming, etc in the context of python as well as the obvious things such as loops, variables, if/then statements, lists, etc.\", '  bad qc', '  great', '  Good', \"  I have read around the library and buy many books about machine learning and find this book is the best one. I have finished almost all chapters of the 1st edition, and find the 2nd edition has enlarged to 850 pages, surely I order this new released one!  It's really a nasty thing I cannot buy it directly from mainland of china.\", \"  As a statistician with limited experience in what the industry now calls 'data science', this book was the perfect translator.  While nothing in the data science field is really all that new for anyone with a statistics, math, or economics background, the terminology and applications are slightly different.  Fortunately this book will get you caught up to speed quickly.  It is rich with detail (it is not a high level book meant for light reading.  It's dense like a college textbook) and it complete with its explanations and python examples.  The author was definitely very thorough (but concise!), and I want to thank him for his organization and editing.  I'd recommend this book to anyone with advanced understanding of statistics (or statistical programming) wanting to learn the latest in data science applications.\", '  Just have to throw in my two cents on the awesomeness of the printed edition. It\\'s an 800 page book, and it\\'s printed on bright white thinner and higher quality paper than most computer books (and most O\\'Reilly books for that matter). It has a nice flex/flow and weight to it and lays open pretty well. It just feels good in your hands and it\\'s well constructed (unlike many recent $200 textbooks that seem specifically designed to fall apart within a semester to ruin their resale value).It\\'s printed in full-color throughout.Honestly I think O\\'Reilly should start offering this quality of printing for more of their most popular books, even charging a bit extra for a \"deluxe printing\". I would pay another $5 for the books I use as frequent references.Anyhow, as to the book\\'s content, I don\\'t know of any better resource for going from neophyte to knowing at least the basics of most all of the latest ML architectures and applications. It\\'s one of those rare books that doesn\\'t tell you anything you don\\'t need to know.All of the chapters are available as Python Jupyter Notebooks (without the majority of the chapter text of course), and they\\'re ready to run on Google Colab for free so you can immediately start playing with any of the examples without needing anything more than a web browser and internet access.It doesn\\'t get better!', '  It\\'s amazing to me how this is the ONLY book of its kind, and it\\'s the RIGHT book for a complete beginner in Machine Learning. Your prerequisites are Calculus and Python, that\\'s it. The book demonstrates what Machine Learning is, how to do it, and offers explicit steps of EVERYTHING!Look, if you\\'re going to perturb models, create new algorithms, or simply want a better understanding of the mathematics behind everything, you will need a strong foundation in Probability and Statistics (I recommend Larsen or Hogg), Linear Algebra, and Convex Optimization wouldn\\'t hurt. You will then be able to tackle the \"big girl\" book, Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie,Tibshirani,Freidman).Yet the point remains, that even after reading the latter, you STILL need to apply it, which means picking a programming language, become acquainted with the appropriate packages, and using it efficiently (yes it takes quite a bit of time to become familiar with all the shortcuts and optimizations).This is a great book and we should be grateful for the author\\'s resources devoted to this valuable entity!', \"  Arguably the best book out there on TensorFlow, Keras and ML in general.  In fact, this is one of the most well written technical books I've ever read!  No kidding!  The code examples are very helpful.  The author not only has a deep understanding of the material but also an outstanding technique for making it accessible.  Too bad I can only give 5 stars.\", '  It\\'s hazardous to make as general a statement as \"this is the best single book...\" but I believe it holds true.  This book manages to cover a broad range of important machine learning topics, yet with sufficient depth so as not to be superficial.  The associated Jupyter notebooks are very well done, and they and the text complement each other nicely.  I have a lot of machine learning books, but if I had to start over again with just one, this would be it.  (Note: this review is based on the first edition, but glancing a the second edition, I believe it even more true.)', \"  As a software engineer, this book really helps me develop a practical intuition about machine learning. The book introduces some of the theory behind algorithms, but more importantly, he digested the math theory part and outline the practical intuition and use case for each algorithm. After reading this book, I have a good understanding of why you would want to use a particular algorithm over one another, and what are the drawbacks of each and every one of them.While I do know the basic probability, linear algebra, and Calculus, I struggle with many other machine learning books as it tends to focus on the academic and theoretical part of Machine Learning. It's a must-read for any engineers looking to introduce Machine Learning into their projects.\", '  This book picks the right level of detail, which is no small feat given the subject\\'s breadth.  It gives key intuition for the important concepts, often using good visual illustrations, but does not overwhelm the reader with details or method variations.  I highly recommend it.  (Note:  other reviews warn that the Kindle version scrambles equations; the e-book version in the O\\'Reilly app does not have this problem.)  For better insight into machine learning theory, read also \"Learning from Data\" by Yaser Abu-Mostafa (which Geron\\'s book\\'s intro also recommends).', \"  Amazing and intuitive overview of the key ML concepts and developments!I've been studying ML since 2016, and I'm struck by how clear and insightful this book is! An interviewer first recommended this book to me -- and it has been the most valuable and cornerstone guide for me thus far!Clear sections, beautiful diagrams, and all diagram-generating code clearly available on a GitHub repo. This is a gold standard for ML instruction! Absolutely amazing!\", '  This book is amazing, I love the tutorials in the GitHub as well. If you’re looking to buy the book, do yourself a favor and get the PDF version from ebooks.com. It’s more expensive but you can still get it in PDF format if you didn’t know. Kindle is a mess and it’s sort of shocking how Amazon doesn’t make more of an effort to improve Kindle for technical books.', '  This book covers tons in the field of machine learning. It is interesting in both the theory and actual implementation (mainly python and tensor-flow). Sometimes I get bogged down by the mathematics, but it has proven helpful for me to take side ventures of learning', '  It is not often that I comment on the books I read, but I felt compelled to do so in this case. I think this is one of the best books on ML/DL in the market. I wish I had had this book when I was starting off on ML.', '  This is a great book. Hits all the important topics as well as a lot of advanced ones and reads like a dream. I have checked out a lot of different texts over the years and this one is my favorite. It is comprehensive and all topics and source code are explained with the insight of a professional.', \"  I'm relatively new to the world of Machine Learning and this book has taught me a lot in a very simple way.\", '  I bought the 1st Edition. Now, there ought to be an easier/cheaper way to get the newer, 2nd Edition.', '  The best deep learning book ever !', '  Great balance of theory and practice.', \"  All that you need to know if you're a Machine Learning beginner, from basic definitions and brief history, all the way up to reinforcement learning. Beside the intuitive and clear explanations, it also contains code snippets to help you get going with your own implementation. It's the best Machine Learning book I've read.\", \"  I just started Machine Learning and this is a very good book for anyone who's out there like me.I loved the content and organization. It's a get go kind of experience learning with this book.\", \"  This is my first reference book for applied machine learning problems. It's mainly intended as a practical book while still introduces a solid part of theory and intuition.\", '  Dos partes, lo basico de machine learning y lo basico de deep learning, muy bien explicado y profundiza lo justo, lo mejor para empezar']\n",
